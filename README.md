📈 FTSE 100 Time-Series Forecasting (LSTM Model)

This project focuses on analysing and forecasting FTSE 100 stock data using deep learning techniques. The workflow includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and building an LSTM model that achieved 1.1 MAPE on validation data.

An interactive web application was also developed to allow users to input company data and receive real-time trend predictions based on the trained model.

🔧 Key Features

Comprehensive data cleaning, preprocessing, and EDA on FTSE 100 historical prices

LSTM-based time series forecasting with a MAPE of 1.1

Interactive web application for real-time prediction and visualisation

Clear data insights and stock behaviour patterns displayed using dashboards

🛠️ Tech Stack
